# Poetical Science: The Publishing Landscape, Visualized.

## About
Poetry in the United States is significantly more regionalized
today than it has been historically. Publishing and printing is more
accessible and citizen literacy is at an all-time high. However,
as the number of emerging poets increases, the amount of poetry the
nation reads regularly is low. The average person first encounters poetry
in elementary school and never revisits it again after their last high
school English course.  


Conversely, the digital space offers more easily accessible
information now than ever before. Libraries have collections entirely
digitized, but most of these collections focus specifically on books
or articles because those are the preferred medium for many people.  


poetry.seen was created to digitally visualize the
poetry landscape of today. In doing so, the site
attempts to both celebrate this landscape
and explore the comparisons between proliferation, popularity, and other
factors that may contribute to it.  


This site is the culminating experience
of two terms of work under the Presidential Scholars Program at Dartmouth
College. One term of COSC 28, Independent Study in Digital Art, was taken
for partial fulfillment of the program.
